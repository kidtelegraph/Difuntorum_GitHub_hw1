My Story 

Hello! I am JM, twenty three with big dreams. I grew up in San Fernando City, La Union. A small city at the northern part of the Philippines. My hobbies are skateboarding, music, painting and I also curate vintage clothes. When I was eight we moved to Doha, Qatar. I studied there third grade until my tenth. Growing up as a skateboarder in a city where it is not common is weird. One day I would love to own a business that is related to all of my interests.
